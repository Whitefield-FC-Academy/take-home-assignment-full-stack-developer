# ⚽ Player Attendance Tracker – Take-Home Assignment

Welcome! 👋  
This take-home assignment is designed to simulate a real-world system at our football club academy, where coaches track player attendance across scheduled sessions.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

We run daily football training sessions split into **morning** and **evening**. Each player is assigned to an **age group**, managed by a specific coach.

Every player books a training plan with a fixed number of regular sessions (e.g., 12 sessions/month) and can get up to **3 complimentary sessions** if they miss any.

We need a system where coaches can:
- Log in and see only the sessions and players for their assigned age group.
- Mark player attendance (regular or complimentary).
- Take a group photo of the players during attendance (only camera).
- Track how many sessions each player has attended, and how many complimentary sessions are used.
